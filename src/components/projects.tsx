      Game store is all about searching for games , add them to your cart and check out .
      I created game store website due to my love for selling games. Back in the days when I was young I always wanted to sell games , just because I used to see my friend spend a lot of money buying video games Lol. I used React , Tailwindcss and Redux for frontend. For the backend I used Expressjs , Nodejs , and Mongo dB. I created the backend Api just because I couldn't find any api for games and trailers at the same time , then I was like "why suffer when i have the super powers of Mern stack" and just like that the Api was created.
