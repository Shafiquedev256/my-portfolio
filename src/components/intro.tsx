    <p>My name is <b>Musingizi Shafiq</b> , I'm a website developer based in Uganda . I decide to become a website developer the day I realised that with the power of wed development  I could bring different ideas from different people allover the world. I am always happy to see how people react when they see what they believe in come to life. </p> 
    <p>My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for clients and startups , also open to explore any opportunity.</p>
